# bitchin.net

My dad used to say "Bitchin'" a lot when I was a kid. This site is dedicated to my dad who died in 2012 due to parkinsons.

I'm learning v and am going to be doing some more with it very soon.

You can see the running version at https://bitchin.net


## install

clone it.
install v

for development run `v run app.v`

To compile run `v app.v` then push `./app` to your server.

You can modify `.env`

LICENSE: do whatever the fuck you want license.
